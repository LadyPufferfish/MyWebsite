                    <p>Imo the best game ever. It is a precision platformer so you WILL die a lot! But the controls are very fair, tight and fun. You can dash, jump and climb/jump away from walls. There is a very big modding and speedrunning community around this game, and everyone is genuinely super nice. Oh right and there are strawberries. Collect them. NOW!</p>

                    <p>I can genuinely NOT tell you ANYTHING about this game without somewhat ruining the experience. You simply HAVE to avoid ANY AND ALL SPOILERS if you want to have the best experience with this game. So, avoid all spoilers and go play it! The most I can tell you about this game is the following: Space-simulator-exploration knowledge-based game.</p>

                <p>Untertale is not necessarily for everyone but it is still incredibly fun. It has one of the best soundtracks in all of gaming. It is an RPG where you don't HAVE to kill anyone! ...you CAN kill everyone! But there will be consequences.</p>
